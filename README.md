# Hacker-Earth-Deep-Learning-Challenge-Keep-Babies-Safe

This is Deep Learning Challenge from hacker earth ,
This is a classification problem in which we have to classify the images that whether they are toys or consumer products and also if we find any text in these images we have to extract it and save it and place it in respective column in csv file.
In this challenge I created my own dataset by scraping files from google using selenium package from python and train my model with that images
and classify the images and I use pythessarct to extract text from images.
